===========

Welcome to the VelocityTools projects. This is a subproject of the 
Apache Velocity project hosted at http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/
The VelocityTools project contains three subprojects:


VelocityStruts

    Includes tools specific to integrating Velocity and Struts. This
    package sits on top of (requires) the VelocityView package.

VelocityView

    Package containing the VelocityViewServlet for rendering Velocity
    templates. There is no controller functionality - it's akin to the 
    JspServlet. It includes toolbox support. (Also contains a
    VelocityLayoutServlet to support more advanced template rendering
    as an alternative to Tiles.)
    

Generic tools

    A collection of general purpose tools that may be used independently of
    the VelocityView or VelocityStruts package (but is included with both).



Build Instructions
------------------

Building the project requires JDK 1.3.1 or higher and ant 1.4.1 
or higher. There is an ant script included that builds the entire 
project, including all three subprojects, documentation, application 
examples, etc. To build the project, start ant in the root directory 
of the project:

> ant
    
To return the project to the original virgin state, execute:

> ant clean

By default, the project will build the VelocityStruts jar, javadoc and
project documentation.

To build only the VelocityStruts jar (which includes both VelocityView classes
and the generic tools), execute:

> ant jar.struts

To build only the VelocityView jar (which includes the generic tools), execute:

> ant jar.view

To build only the generic tools jar, execute:

> ant jar.generic

To build the simple example for VelocityView, execute:

> ant example.simple

To build the VelocityStruts example, execute:

> ant example.struts


Please note:

- To compile VelocityStruts with JDK 1.3, you *must* define a jdbc.jar property
  somewhere in your build.properties or the build.properties provided with this
  project.
  
- When building the javadoc with JDK 1.3, you will get a number of warnings if you
  do not have a xerces.jar property defined somewhere in the build.properties.  
  However, these warnings can generally be ignored.

- During the documentation build process DVSL emits several of the following error
  messages. They can be ingnored. A bug report has already been filed.

  [dvsl] [error] ResourceManager: unable to find resource 'VM_global_library.vm' in any resource loader.

- When compiling with JDK 1.4 there is a deprecation warning in LinkTool
  involving java.net.URLEncoder.  This is to maintain compatibility with JDK 1.3.
  However, when running the code on 1.4, the new, non-deprecated method is used.

The build process has been tested with JDK 1.3.1 and JDK 1.4.1. The 
included example applications have been tested with Tomcat 4.0.4, 
Tomcat 4.1.24, and Resin 2.1.0.

If you observe any problems with the build process, please report this
to the Velocity users mailing list, velocity-user@jakarta.apache.org, and
put [veltools] in the subject line.
